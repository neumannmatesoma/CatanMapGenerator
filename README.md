# Overview
This is my project for the 2nd year specialisation topic laboratory called **Catan (board game) Map Generator Online Tool for Balanced Gameplay**. You can read more about my topic in <a href="https://www.aut.bme.hu/Task/24-25-tavasz/ZENG-Catan-board-game">english</a> and <a href="https://www.aut.bme.hu/Task/24-25-tavasz/Catan-tarsasjatek-Terkep">hungarian</a>. In the following paragraphs you can read about my ideas for the project and some other implementation and design decisons about the project itself, the folder/file organization and the overall scheme of the project.

## Language and framework plans
I plan to make a static website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Since the website only has one page which changes as a result of interactions., I want to use only one HTML file and the different user interactions change the content of the site.
## File/folder organization
I want to use a generic organization plan for this, which consits of a main **project** folder and inside a **resources** folder. The main project folder containes the HTML files and the resources folder. Inside the resources folder there are folders for **CSS** and **JS**.</br>It should look something like this:</br>
> main_folder</br>
> &emsp;mockups</br>
> &emsp;&emsp;*mockups for design...*</br>
> &emsp;website</br>
> &emsp;&emsp;resources</br>
> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;css</br>
> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*css files...*</br>
> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;js</br>
> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*javascript files...*</br>
> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;images</br>
> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*image files...*</br>
> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;data</br>
> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*data files...*</br>
> &emsp;&emsp;index.html</br>
> &emsp;&emsp;*other html files...*
## Design plans
I plan to make mockups for the basic layout (divs and other stuff) and mockups for the actual design of the website. These can be found in the mockups folder.
