# Overview
## Description
As part of my coursework in Spring 2024, I'm developing a static web application inspired by the classic Catan board game. This project was completed as part of my university topic laboratory course. The topic is called **Catan (board game) Map Generator Online Tool for Balanced Gameplay** and more information can be found about it in <a href="https://www.aut.bme.hu/Task/24-25-tavasz/ZENG-Catan-board-game">english</a> and <a href="https://www.aut.bme.hu/Task/24-25-tavasz/Catan-tarsasjatek-Terkep">hungarian</a>. The project was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, with a focus on creating a visually engaging and interactive user experience. My goal is to strengthen my front-end development skills while creatively translating the atmosphere of a well-known board game into a digital format. 
## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
## File/folder organization
I followed a generic organization plan for this, which consits of a main **project** folder and inside a **resources** folder. The main project folder containes the HTML files and the resources folder. Inside the resources folder there are folders for **CSS** and **JS**.</br>It should look something like this:</br>
> main_folder</br>
> &emsp;mockups</br>
> &emsp;&emsp;*mockups for design...*</br>
> &emsp;website</br>
> &emsp;&emsp;resources</br>
> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;css</br>
> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*css files...*</br>
> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;js</br>
> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*javascript files...*</br>
> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;images</br>
> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*image files...*</br>
> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;data</br>
> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*data files...*</br>
> &emsp;&emsp;index.html</br>
## Designs
I created mockups for the initial layout and design of the website, which can be found in the **mockups** folder. Please note that these are slightly outdated, as the design has evolved over time â€” including updated background colors and additional layout elements.
